# Fixed Version of undetected-chromedriver

## Overview
This fork of undetected-chromedriver addresses critical cleanup issues that cause resource leaks and crashes on Windows systems.

## Fixed Issues

### Windows Handle Invalid Error Fix
The original package had issues with proper cleanup of browser processes, leading to the following common errors:

```
Exception ignored in: <function Chrome.__del__ at 0x00000215F7989A80>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Paul Evolve\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Lib\site-packages\undetected_chromedriver\__init__.py", line 769, in __del__
  File "C:\Users\Paul Evolve\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Lib\site-packages\undetected_chromedriver\__init__.py", line 758, in quit
OSError: [WinError 6] The handle is invalid

Exception ignored in: <function Patcher.__del__ at 0x00000215F7988EA0>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Paul Evolve\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Lib\site-packages\undetected_chromedriver\patcher.py", line 273, in __del__
